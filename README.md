# Terms of Service Annotation
This is a chrome extention for annotating terms of service.  

This project was forked from Jon Udell's DigiPo extension, described here: http://digipo.io/doku.php?id=digipo:materials:digipo_extension

## Purpose
The tool is intended to help in crowd-sourcing annotations of educational technology companies' terms of service. We have prepared a set of questions that someone might be interested in asking about a company's terms of service.

## How it Works
Using this chrome extension, users can select text on a webpage, and then push that text along with other metadata as query parameters to a predefined website, in this case https://adamcroom.com/termsofservice/submit/. That website will then use those query parameters to prefill fields in a form. The user can modify or add to the form before submitting the information for the project's database.
